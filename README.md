# CMPE 537-HW3
BOUN Fall-20 CMPE537 HW-3 Group Project

In this assignment, we worked as a group to classify a set of images using various methods and experimented with combinations of these methods. The image prediction pipeline consists of 4 steps:

Feature Extraction, Finding Dictionary Centers, Feature Quantization and Classification

We have implemented a number of methods to achieve these goals. We, then, combined these methods to create full pipelines that predict image tags. The “Caltech20” dataset given with the assignment is used for training and testing.

*Result are in the project report.
